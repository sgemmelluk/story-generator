# story-generator

Personal project to learn using the openAI API.

React client using Vite instead of create-react-app
Express JS server to call out to the ChatGPT completions API to generate a story based on users input.

If you want to try this out you will need to generate your own openAI key and place it in a .env file
with the key OPENAI_API_KEY alongside the server.js file location.
